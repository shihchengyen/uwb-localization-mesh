# Audio Files Directory

This directory contains audio files for the UWB localization mesh audio system.

Place your .wav and .mp3 files here. The filenames should match the track names in the playlists.

Example files:
- crazy-carls-brickhouse-tavern.wav
- funky-bossanova-guitar.wav  
- guitar-on-loop.mp3

The audio files will be loaded by the RPi audio players when track switching commands are sent.
